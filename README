For Blender 3+ (tested with 4.1)
TODO(?):

Import/export vertex colors
SURFs
Two-sided faces? (detect and merge on import, split on export)
Fix numeric instabilities in rig roll value computation for the most part, but some issues still remain
Animation export is still not as expected
See branches for Blender 2.78 and 2.91 scripts

And this is the best version I can make for now.
